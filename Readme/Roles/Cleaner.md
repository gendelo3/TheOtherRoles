# Cleaner (Impostor)
Clean & Kill

The Cleaner has the extra ability to clean dead bodys and remove them entirely from the map. Beside this he can kill like a normal impostor. Dont get confused with the Vulture. :-)

## Notes
- Clean- and Kill-Buttons are conntected to each other. They set each others cooldowns to the specified time.
- If there is a Cleaner in the game, there can't be a Vulture.
