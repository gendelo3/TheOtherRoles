# Hacker (Crewmate)
Hack the systems

If the Hacker activates the "Hacker mode", the Hacker gets more information than others from the admin table and vitals for a set duration.
Otherwise they see the same information as everyone else. Admin table: The Hacker can see the colors (or color types) of the players on the table.
Vitals: The Hacker can see how long dead players have been dead for.
The Hacker can access his mobile gadgets (vitals & admin table), with a maximum of charges (uses) and a configurable amount of tasks needed to recharge.
While accessing those mobile gadgets, the Hacker is not able to move.

## Notes
- If the Morphling morphs or the Camouflager camouflages, the colors on the admin table change accordingly
- During the meetings you can see, whether a player wears a darker or a lighter color, represented by (D) or (L) in the names.
