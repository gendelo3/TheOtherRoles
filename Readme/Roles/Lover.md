# Lover (Seccondary)
Win with your love

There are always two Lovers which are linked together.
Their primary goal is it to stay alive together until the end of the game.
If one Lover dies (and the option is activated), the other Lover suicides.
You can select if Lovers are able to have a second role (could be a Neutral, Crewmate or Impostor Role)
You can specify the chance of one Lover being an Impostor.
The Lovers never know the role of their partner, they only see who their partner is.
The Lovers win, if they are both alive when the game ends. They can also win with their original team (e.g. a dead Impostor Lover can win with the Impostors, an Arsonist Lover can still achieve an Arsonist win)
If one of the Lovers is a killer (i.e. Jackal/Sidekick/Impostor), they can achieve a "Lovers solo win" where only the Lovers win.
If there is no killer among the Lovers (e.g. an Arsonist Lover + Crewmate Lover) and they are both alive when the game ends, they win together with the Crewmates.
If there's a team Impostor/Jackal Lover in the game, the tasks of a Crewmate Lover won't be counted (for a task win) as long as they're alive. If the Lover dies, their tasks will also be counted.
You can enable an exclusive chat only for Lovers

## Notes
- In a 2 Cremates vs 2 Impostors (or 2 members of team Jackal) and the Lovers are not in the same team, the game is not automatically over since the Lovers can still achieve a solo win. E.g. if there are the following roles Impostor + ImpLover + Lover + Crewmate left, the game will not end and the next kill will decide if the Impostors or Lovers win.
- The Lovers can change if the Shifter takes the role of a Lovers
