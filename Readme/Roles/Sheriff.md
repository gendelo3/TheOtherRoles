# Sheriff (Crewmate)
Shoot the bad guys

The Sheriff has the ability to kill Impostors. If they try to kill a Crewmate, they die instead.

## Notes
- If the Sheriff shoots the person the Medic shielded, the Sheriff and the shielded person both remain unharmed.
- If the Sheriff shoots a Mini Impostor, the Sheriff dies if the Mini is still growing up. If it's 18, the Mini Impostor dies.
