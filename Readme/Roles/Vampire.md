# Vampire (Impostor)
Bite and avoid the garlics

The Vampire is an Impostor, that can bite other player. Bitten players die after a configurable amount of time.
If the Vampire spawn chance is greater 0 (even if there is no Vampire in the game), all players can place one garlic.
If a victim is near a garlic, the "Bite Button" turns into the default "Kill Button" and the Vampire can only perform a normal kill.

## Notes
- If a bitten player is still alive when a meeting is being called, they die at the start of the meeting.
- The cooldown is the same as the default kill cooldown (+ the kill delay if the Vampire bites the target).
- If there is a Vampire in the game, there can't be a Warlock.
