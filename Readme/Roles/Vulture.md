# Vulture (Neutral)
Eat corpses to win

The Vulture does not have any tasks, they have to win the game as a solo.
The Vulture is a neutral role that must eat a specified number of corpses (depending on the options) in order to win.
Depending on the options, when a player dies, the Vulture gets an arrow pointing to the corpse. If there is a Vulture in the game, there can't be a Cleaner.
