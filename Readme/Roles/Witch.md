# Witch (Impostor)
Jinx everyone

The Witch is an Impostor who has the ability to cast a spell on other players.
During the next meeting, the spellbound player will be highlighted and they'll die right after the meeting.
There are multiple options listed down below with which you can configure to fit your taste.
Similar to the Vampire, shields and blanks will be checked twice (at the end of casting the spell on the player and at the end of the meeting, when the spell will be activated).
This can result in players being marked as spelled during the meeting, but not dying in the end (when they get a shield or the Witch gets blanked after they were spelled by the Witch).
If the Witch dies before the meeting starts or if the Witch is being guessed during the meeting, the spellbound players will be highlighted but they'll survive in any case.
Depending on the options you can choose whether voting the Witch out will save all the spellbound players or not.

## Notes
- The spellbound players will die before the voted player dies (which might trigger e.g. trigger an Impostor win condition, even if the Witch is the one being voted)
